# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a widely used **discriminative** classification model $\mathbb{P}(y \mid \boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\theta})$, where $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^D$ is a fixed-dimensional input vector, $y \in\{1, \ldots, K\}$ is the class label, and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ are the parameters. If $K=2$, this is known as binary logistic regression, and if $K>2$, it is known as multinomial logistic regression, or alternatively, multiclass logistic regression {cite}`pml1Book`.
