# Introduction

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems.
It is a type of machine learning that is particularly good at learning from large and complex datasets,
and is used in a wide range of applications including image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and robotics.

Modern Deep Learning is still based on the core idea of Neural Networks, but it has been extended to a much larger scale with
the rise of stronger compute power.

We are entering a new era of Artificial Intelligence, let's buckle up and get ready for the ride!
