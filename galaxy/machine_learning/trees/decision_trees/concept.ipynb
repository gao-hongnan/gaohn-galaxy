Observations directed to a parent node are next directed to one of that parent's two children nodes. | In a decision tree, node A is a parent node with two child nodes B and C. Observations that satisfy the decision rule at node A are directed to one of its child nodes. |\n",
    "| Rule | Each parent node has a rule that determines toward which of the child nodes an observation will be directed. The rule is based on the value of one (and only one) of an observation's predictors. | In a decision tree, the decision rule at node A might be \"If bill length <= 43.35mm, go to node B; otherwise, go to node C.\" |\n",
    "| Buds | Buds are nodes that have not yet been split. In other words, they are children that are eligible to become parents. Nodes are only considered buds during the training process. Nodes that are never split are considered leaves. | In a decision tree, before node A is split into nodes B and C, it is a bud. |\n",
    "| Leaf | Leaves, also known as *terminal nodes*, are nodes that are never split. Observations move through a decision tree until reaching a leaf. The fitted value of a test observation is determined by the training observations that land in the same leaf. | In a decision tree, nodes B and C are examples of leaves. Observations that satisfy the decision rule at a leaf node are assigned the corresponding fitted value, which is typically the average of the training observations in that leaf. |\n"

    "## Pros and Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "This is well known, if you just use a very naive and plain decision tree, then it is almost guaranteed to not generalize well. A prime example modified from Data Science From Scratch is as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "> For the sake of example, we are using features of a customer of a bank to predict his credit default rating (discrete ratings). And also just hypothetically say, we are also using a potentially useless feature security social number which is uniquely generated for each customer (note in real world, I do not think we will be feeding this feature in in the first place as in general, we cannot derive useful information from this number). Then further assume, our tree splits to the last node, where the last node is the security number attribute, and then our tree will have $m$ nodes, where $m$ is the number of data (assume distinct customers in dataset). This will cause a problem, because each node has 0 entropy and future predictions will always look into this node of security number (actually if the SSN is unique, then how does tree go down to that unique number for unseen predictions)?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### High Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "This term is almost a synonym to **overfitting**. Decision Trees are often termed as a **model with high variance**. Quoting a well explained answer from [here](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/48166/why-can-decision-trees-have-a-high-amount-of-variance#:~:text=A%20decision%20tree%20has%20high,predictions%20to%20every%20single%20input.&text=THEN%20team%20A%20wins.,game%20in%20your%20training%20data.), it says:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuitive answer**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is relatively simple if you understand what variance refers to in this context. A model has high variance if it is very sensitive to (small) changes in the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree has high variance because, if you imagine a very large tree, it can basically adjust its predictions to every single input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider you wanted to predict the outcome of a soccer game. A decision tree could make decisions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> IF \n",
    "> \n",
    ">  1. player X is on the field AND\n",
    ">  2. team A has a home game AND\n",
    ">  3. the weather is sunny AND \n",
    ">  4. the number of attending fans >= 26000 AND\n",
    ">  5. it is past 3pm  \n",
    "> \n",
    "> THEN team A wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the tree is very deep, it will get very specific and you may only have one such game in your training data. It probably would not be appropriate to base your predictions on just one example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you make a small change e.g. set the number of attending fans to 25999, a decision tree might give you a completely different answer (because the game now doesn't meet the 4th condition). \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression, for example, would not be so sensitive to a small change because it is limited (\"biased\" -> see [bias-variance tradeoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff)) to linear relationships and cannot represent sudden changes from 25999 to 26000 fans. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's why it is important to not make decision trees arbitrary large/deep. This limits its variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "(See e.g. [here](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/20355/23305) for more on how random forests can help with this further.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Follow Up [post](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/20304/why-do-we-pick-random-features-in-random-forest/20355#20355) on how RF can help mitigate**\n",
    "\n",
    "Can connect back to intuition of ensembling by Francis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of random forests is basically to build many decision trees (or other weak learners) that are *decorrelated*, so that their average is less prone to overfitting (reducing the variance). One way is subsampling of the training set. The reason why subsampling features can further decorrelate trees is, that if there are few dominating features, these features will be selected in many trees even for different subsamples, making the trees in the forest similar (correlated) again **and we do not want them to be too similar!**\n",
    "\n",
    "The lower the number of sampled features, the higher the decorrelation effect. On the other hand, the bias of a random forest is the same as the bias of any of the sampled trees (see for example Elements of Statistical Learning), but the randomization of random forests restrict the model, so that the bias is usually higher than a fully-grown (unpruned) tree. You are correct in that you can expect a higher bias if you sample fewer features. So, \"feature bagging\" really gives you a classical trade-off in bias and variance."
