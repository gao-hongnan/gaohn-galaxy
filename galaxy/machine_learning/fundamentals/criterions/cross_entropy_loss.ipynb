    "We need to make sense of entropy in the form of a loss function, we have to just enhance our thinking a little.\n",

    "\n",
    "Intuitively, take the cat vs dog binary classification again, we made 11 predictions for ONLY ONE query image using different model, and find that after going through many layers, the **softmax** predictions on the logits are as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[\n",
    "    [0.0, 1.0],\n",
    "    [0.1, 0.9],\n",
    "    [0.2, 0.8],\n",

    "\n",
    "where the first index corresponds to the logits of class 0 and second index corresponds to the logits of class 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `[1, 0]` means the model is 100 percent confident the prediction is a class 0 (cat), and obviously we need to punish the model for spitting nonsense like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see in the `binary_cross_entropy` function below, we only need to add up two things. And note that we are hinging on class 1 and therefore `y_true[0] * log(y_pred[0]+eps)` goes to 0 as we are just relying on our feedback of probability of class 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "And in our graph, we can see that as predictions gets more wrong, meaning to say, if the query image is a dog, but our predictions is `[1, 0]`, which says it is a cat, our entropy loss will blow up to very high because \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y_true[1] * log(y_pred[1]+eps) -> 1 * log(1+eps) -> almost infinity\n",

    "1. We one-hot encoded.\n",
    "2. We only look at class 1's probability and that's enough as we can deduce class 0's probability anyways.\n",
    "\n",
    "And conversely, note how the entropy loss goes to 0 if our prediction is say `[0, 1]`. In general, as our probability for the query image gets close to 1, or in agreement with our class, then our entropy loss becomes smaller.\n",
