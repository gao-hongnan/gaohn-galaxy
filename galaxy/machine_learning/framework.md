# The Machine Learning Framework

We will not dive into deep theoratical frameworks such as PAC learning, VC dimension, etc. Instead, we will do a gentle introduction using basic probability.

## The Naive Probabilistic Framework

This section details the mathematical framework that we will use throughout. It is
naive because it is not written rigorously. But for our purpose, this is sufficient
to gain a good understanding of the concepts.

[This article here](https://mostafa-samir.github.io/ml-theory-pt1/) really lays out
the framework in an intuitive manner. Please read this before proceeding. Alongside
with Alexander Jung's book, Machine Learning: The Basics, this should give anyone
a solid foundation in how to think about machine learning.

## More Formal Framework

Read [Foundations of Machine Learning](https://cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/mlbook/) for a more formal introduction to the framework.
