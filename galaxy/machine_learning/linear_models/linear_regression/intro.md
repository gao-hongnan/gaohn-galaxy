# Linear Regression

In this chapter, we discuss linear regression, which is a very widely used method for predicting a real-valued output (also called the dependent variable or target) $y \in \mathbb{R}$, given a vector of real-valued inputs (also called independent variables, explanatory variables, or covariates) $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^D$. The key property of the model is that the expected value of the output is assumed to be a linear function of the input, $\mathbb{E}[y \mid \boldsymbol{x}]=\boldsymbol{w}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x}$, which makes the model easy to interpret, and easy to fit to data {cite}`pml1Book`.
