    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a **corpus** consisting of $5$ documents as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "corpus = [\n",
    "    \"The sun is the largest celestial body in the solar system\",\n",
    "    \"The solar system consists of the sun and eight revolving planets\",\n",
    "    \"Ra was the Egyptian Sun God\",\n",
    "    \"The Pyramids were the pinnacle of Egyptian architecture\",\n",
    "    \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\",\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "corpus_names = [\"doc_1\", \"doc_2\", \"doc_3\", \"doc_4\", \"doc_5\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where each element in `corpus` corresponds to a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unique vocabularies in lexicographical order are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "vocabulary = ['and', 'architecture', 'body', 'brown', ...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, the `corpus` is our set $\\mathcal{S}$ and the `vocabulary` is our set $\\mathcal{V}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Term Frequency (TF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose now we have a new document `query` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "query = \"Why did the chicken cross the road?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and we want to rank the documents in `corpus` according to their relevance to `query`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to start out is by eliminating documents that do not contain all the words \"why\", \"did\", \"the\", \"chicken\", \"cross\" and \"road\". However, none of the\n",
    "documents will be eliminated since all of them contain the common word \"the\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To further distinguish them, we can count the number of times each word from `query` occurs in each document. The number of times a word occurs in a document is called its **term frequency**. For example, in `doc_4`, the word `the` occurred $2$ times, while in `doc_1`, it occurred $3$ times. Hence we can intuitively rank `doc_1` over `doc_4` as being more relevant to `query`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"the\" is very common and can skew the results by giving too much emphasis to documents that happen to use it more often, instead of focusing on more meaningful terms like \"chicken\", \"cross\", and \"road\". To address this issue, an inverse document frequency factor is added to reduce the weight of frequently occurring terms and increase the weight of rarely occurring terms, making them more significant in distinguishing relevant and non-relevant documents and terms.\n"

    "\n",
    "The log transformation is used to \"squash\" the term frequencies to reduce the impact of very high frequency terms, as they can disproportionately dominate the weighting of a document. By using log, the scaling factor becomes less significant for very high frequency terms, while still allowing for a differentiation between non-zero and zero term frequency. The logarithmic scaling also ensures that the range of values is compressed, allowing for a better distribution of weights across the different terms. Overall, using the log transformation helps to normalize the term frequency values and prevent any one term from dominating the analysis."
