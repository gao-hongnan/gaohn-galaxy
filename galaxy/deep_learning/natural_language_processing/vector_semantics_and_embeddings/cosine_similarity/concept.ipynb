One way to see this is to note that the cosine distance is half of the squared Euclidean distance of the $L_2$ normalization of the vectors, and squared Euclidean distance does not satisfy the triangle inequality either. To repair the triangle inequality property while maintaining the same ordering, it is necessary to convert to angular distance or Euclidean distance. Alternatively, the triangular inequality that does work for angular distances can be expressed directly in terms of the cosines; see below."

    "## Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of Angles\n",
    "\n",
    "The following properties are adapted from [Wikipedia: Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity).\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting similarity ranges from -1 meaning exactly opposite, to 1 meaning exactly the same, with 0 indicating orthogonality or decorrelation, while inbetween values indicate intermediate similarity or dissimilarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To interpet the cosine similarity, we have the follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the angle between the two vectors is $0^{\\circ}$, then the cosine similarity is $1$. This means that the two vectors are identical.\n",
    "- If the angle between the two vectors is $90^{\\circ}$, then the cosine similarity is $0$. This means that the two vectors are orthogonal.\n",
    "- If the angle between the two vectors is $180^{\\circ}$, then the cosine similarity is $-1$. This means that the two vectors are exactly opposite.\n",
    "- If the angle between the two vectors is anywhere between $0^{\\circ}$ and $90^{\\circ}$, then the cosine similarity is positive. This means that the two vectors are similar to the extent of the angle between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**For text matching**, the attribute vectors $u$ and $v$ are usually the term frequency vectors of the documents. Cosine similarity can be seen as a method of normalizing document length during comparison. In the case of information retrieval, the cosine similarity of two documents will range from $0 \\rightarrow 1$, since the term frequencies cannot be negative. This remains true when using TF-IDF weights. The angle between two term frequency vectors cannot be greater than $90^{\\circ}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the attribute vectors are normalized by subtracting the vector means (e.g., $u-\\bar{u}$ ), the measure is called the centered cosine similarity and is equivalent to the Pearson correlation coefficient. For an example of centering,\n",
    "if $u=\\left[u_1, u_2\\right]^T$, then $\\bar{u}=\\left[\\frac{\\left(u_1+u_2\\right)}{2}, \\frac{\\left(u_1+u_2\\right)}{2}\\right]^T$, so $u-\\bar{u}=\\left[\\frac{\\left(u_1-u_2\\right)}{2}, \\frac{\\left(-u_1+u_2\\right)}{2}\\right]^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationship to Euclidean Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "The most noteworthy property of cosine similarity is that it reflects a relative, rather than absolute, comparison of the individual vector dimensions. For any constant $a$ and vector $V$, the vectors $V$ and $a V$ are maximally similar. The measure is thus most appropriate for data where frequency is more important than absolute values; notably, term frequency in documents. However more recent metrics with a grounding in information theory, such as JensenShannon, SED, and triangular divergence have been shown to have improved semantics in at least some contexts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cosine similarity is related to Euclidean distance as follows. Denote Euclidean distance by the usual $\\|A-B\\|$, and observe that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\|A-B\\|^2=(A-B) \\cdot(A-B)=\\|A\\|^2+\\|B\\|^2-2(A \\cdot B) \\text { (polarization identity) }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "by expansion. When $A$ and $B$ are normalized to unit length, $\\|A\\|^2=\\|B\\|^2=1$ so this expression is equal to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2(1-\\cos (A, B)) \\text {. }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the cosine distance can be expressed in terms of Euclidean distance as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D_C(A, B)=\\frac{\\|A-B\\|^2}{2} \\quad \\text { when } \\quad\\|A\\|^2=\\|B\\|^2=1 .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Euclidean distance is called the chord distance (because it is the length of the chord on the unit circle) and it is the Euclidean distance between the vectors which were normalized to unit sum of squared values within them."
