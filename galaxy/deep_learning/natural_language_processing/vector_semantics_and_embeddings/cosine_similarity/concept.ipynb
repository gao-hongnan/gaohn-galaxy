    "## Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Following extracted from Wikipedia:\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting similarity ranges from -1 meaning exactly opposite, to 1 meaning exactly the same, with 0 indicating orthogonality or decorrelation, while inbetween values indicate intermediate similarity or dissimilarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For text matching, the attribute vectors $u$ and $v$ are usually the term frequency vectors of the documents. Cosine similarity can be seen as a method of normalizing document length during comparison. In the case of information retrieval, the cosine similarity of two documents will range from $0 \\rightarrow 1$, since the term frequencies cannot be negative. This remains true when using TF-IDF weights. The angle between two term frequency vectors cannot be greater than $90^{\\circ}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the attribute vectors are normalized by subtracting the vector means (e.g., $u-\\bar{u}$ ), the measure is called the centered cosine similarity and is equivalent to the Pearson correlation coefficient. For an example of centering,\n",
    "if $u=\\left[u_1, u_2\\right]^T$, then $\\bar{u}=\\left[\\frac{\\left(u_1+u_2\\right)}{2}, \\frac{\\left(u_1+u_2\\right)}{2}\\right]^T$, so $u-\\bar{u}=\\left[\\frac{\\left(u_1-u_2\\right)}{2}, \\frac{\\left(-u_1+u_2\\right)}{2}\\right]^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term cosine distance is commonly used for the complement of cosine similarity in positive space, that is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text { cosine distance }=D_C(u, v):=1-S_C(u, v) .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the cosine distance is not a true distance metric as it does not exhibit the triangle inequality property-or, more formally, the Schwarz inequality-and it violates the coincidence axiom. One way to see this is to note that the cosine distance is half of the squared Euclidean distance of the $L_2$ normalization of the vectors, and squared Euclidean distance does not satisfy the triangle inequality either. To repair the triangle inequality property while maintaining the same ordering, it is necessary to convert to angular distance or Euclidean distance. Alternatively, the triangular inequality that does work for angular distances can be expressed directly in terms of the cosines; see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most noteworthy property of cosine similarity is that it reflects a relative, rather than absolute, comparison of the individual vector dimensions. For any constant $a$ and vector $V$, the vectors $V$ and $a V$ are maximally similar. The measure is thus most appropriate for data where frequency is more important than absolute values; notably, term frequency in documents. However more recent metrics with a grounding in information theory, such as JensenShannon, SED, and triangular divergence have been shown to have improved semantics in at least some contexts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cosine similarity is related to Euclidean distance as follows. Denote Euclidean distance by the usual $\\|A-B\\|$, and observe that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\|A-B\\|^2=(A-B) \\cdot(A-B)=\\|A\\|^2+\\|B\\|^2-2(A \\cdot B) \\text { (polarization identity) }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "by expansion. When $A$ and $B$ are normalized to unit length, $\\|A\\|^2=\\|B\\|^2=1$ so this expression is equal to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2(1-\\cos (A, B)) \\text {. }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the cosine distance can be expressed in terms of Euclidean distance as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D_C(A, B)=\\frac{\\|A-B\\|^2}{2} \\quad \\text { when } \\quad\\|A\\|^2=\\|B\\|^2=1 .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Euclidean distance is called the chord distance (because it is the length of the chord on the unit circle) and it is the Euclidean distance between the vectors which were normalized to unit sum of squared values within them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Null distribution: For data which can be negative as well as positive, the null distribution for cosine similarity is the distribution of the dot product of two independent random unit vectors. This distribution has a mean of zero and a variance of $1 / n$ (where $n$ is the number of dimensions), and although the distribution is bounded between $-1$ and $+1$, as $n$ grows large the distribution is increasingly well-approximated by the normal distribution. Other types of data such as bitstreams, which only take the values 0 or 1 , the null distribution takes a different form and may have a nonzero mean."

    "If they were pointing in the same direction, the dot product would be positive, indicating similarity.\n",
